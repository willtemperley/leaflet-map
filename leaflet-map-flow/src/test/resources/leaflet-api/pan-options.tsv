animate	Boolean		If true, panning will always be animated if possible. If false, it will not animate panning, either resetting the map view if panning more than a screen away, or just setting a new offset for the map pane (except for panBy which always does the latter).
duration	Number	0.25	Duration of animated panning, in seconds.
easeLinearity	Number	0.25	The curvature factor of panning animation easing (third parameter of the Cubic Bezier curve). 1.0 means linear animation, and the smaller this number, the more bowed the curve.
noMoveStart	Boolean	false	If true, panning won't fire movestart event on start (used internally for panning inertia).
